<h1>Jabberwocky</h1>
<h2><span>BY GEORGE HASKELL </span>BY LEWIS CARROLL</h2>
<article>
    <p class="stanza1">'Twas <span>brillig,</span> and the slithy toves<br>Did gyre and gimble in the wabe:<br>All <span>mimsy</span> were the borogoves,<br>And the mome raths outgrabe.</p>
    <p class="stanza2">"<span>Beware the Jabberwock</span>, my son!<br>The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!<br>Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun<br>The frumious Bandersnatch!"</p>
    <p class="stanza1">He took his vorpal sword in hand;<br>Long time the manxome foe he sought&mdash;<br>So rested he by the Tumtum tree<br>And stood awhile in thought.</p>
