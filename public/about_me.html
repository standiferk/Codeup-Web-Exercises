                <p><strong>BEER BREWING</strong><p>
                <p>I have failed more times than succeeded.  The definition of failed here is the production of a fermented alcohol product I would not consume if a double-dare with money involved were the challenge.</p>
                <p>However, I have had my fair share of successes.  Satisfaction lies with creating a beer you would invite your friends over to share.  One step beyond that is a beer you would put on tap and keep to yourself.</p></div>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>Don't get it twisted.  When I say cycling there is a motor involved.  Preferably 103 cubic inches of American made power that with a twist of the throttle will put in total control of the your whole world and the road in front of you.</p> 
                <p>This is the one "hobby" that will give you the feeling of exclusive membership into a brother/sisterhood of seemingly countless brethren while simultaneously giving you a solitairy freedom known only to those who ride.</p>
                <p>Even if you are riding with someone you are truly alone.  An unexplainable dicotemy that in order to fully understan must be experienced.</p>
                <p>100% of the control is in your hands.  It's you and the machine whether you're riding with someone or not.  Your fait, your destiny, your life all lay in your hands.  </p>
                <p>Riding is a feeling like no other.  Very hard to explain but very easy to understand once you've been doing it for a while.  Which is why the standard answer from most motorcycle riders</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>In my life I've either owned or my parents have owned many breeds of mans best friend and in all my k-9 experiences the one breed I will host for the rest of my days is the dachshound.<p>
                <p>I know everyone had their favorite breed but this one is mine.  Specifically the mini-dachshound.  I currently "own" four of them.  The "own" is quotations because there is some dispute over who owns who.</p>
                <p>Whether I own them or they're just using me for money is not at issue here.  These little dogs are the most human of companions without having to actually interact with humans.</p>
                <p>Unconditional understanding is what I get with this breed.  Other breed could offer this same quality</p>
