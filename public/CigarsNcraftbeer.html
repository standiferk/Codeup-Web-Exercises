			<h1>CIGARS-n-CRAFT BEER</h1>
			<p>These are a few of my favorite things...<em>especially together</em>.</p> 
				<p>This page will be dedicated to pairing these two things for maximum enjoyment</p>
		</header>
			<h2>Cigars</h2><h2>Craft Beer</h2>
			<p>Not many things bring me joy here are two of those things.  Full disclosure; finding the cigars will be easier than finding the beer.  A lot of the beers are local to a city and some as small as a single brewery.  That being said if they're on this site they're worth the trip for true craft beer lovers</p>
			<p>I will share my favorite pairing of course but I encourage everyone to share some of their favorites as well.  There is a huge community out there for just such an endeavor and who knows, we might just make some contacts/friends in different locations</p>
